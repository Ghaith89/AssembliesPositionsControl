# AssembliesPositionsControl
This project aims to control facade projects that includes blocks through Excel so we can double check if one of theelements is in a wrong position before we run the clash detection.
The script is prepared to run using the Ironpython editor in Rhino3D. It does not need any user interaction. by running it the user gets all the position information for all block instances in the Rhino file.
